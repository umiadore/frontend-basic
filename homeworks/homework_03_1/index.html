  <h1>Basic document flow</h1>

<p class = "yellow-box">
  I am a basic block level element. My adjacent block level elements sit on new
  lines below me.
</p>

<p class="yellow-box">
  By default we span 100% of the width of our parent element, and we are as tall
  as our child content. Our total width and height is our content + padding +
  border width/height.
</p>

<p class ="yellow-box">
  We are separated by our margins. Because of margin collapsing, we are
  separated by the width of one of our margins, not both.
</p>

<p class = "yellow-box">
  Inline elements <span class ="blue-box">like this one</span> and <span class ="blue-box">this one</span> sit on
  the same line along with adjacent text nodes, if there is space on the same
  line. Overflowing inline elements will
  <span class ="blue-box">wrap onto a new line if possible (like this one containing text)</span>,
  or just go on to a new line if not, much like this image will do:
  <img src="long.jpeg" alt="snippet of cloth" />
